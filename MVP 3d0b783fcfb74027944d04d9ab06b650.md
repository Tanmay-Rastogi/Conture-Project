# MVP

I think that Discord can serve our value. 

Making a discord server for this will help us have some initial users and a lot of interviews to have their thoughts. This process will give us traction to show to funding teams. And this will also verify our idea.

 What to do before launching MVP:

- [ ]  Specify timelines [Definition in Nov, Build in Dec + Jan & launch in Jan + Feb]
- [ ]  Research and find out "Why people use social media?" - My assumption is "They use in free time and to talk and stalk and entertain themselves" - Started
- [ ]  Talk between us to discuss strategies. [2 to 3 days]
- [ ]  Discuss what can be given in MVP [2 to 3 days]
- [ ]  Specify the requirements before building it on Discord [2 to 3 days]
- [ ]  Get someone who can help us with Discord [5 to 7 days]
- [ ]  Start building
- [ ]  Test all cases
- [ ]  Setup user flow
- [ ]  Launch pre-marketing
- [ ]  BOOM-BOOM!
